        <h1>The second man within</h1>
       <p> The second man within is science fiction by Kingsley Nkrumah, published
        in 2020; it is an ongoing project with the belief that a second within
        posses foreknowledge ability that helps the old testament and current
        seers to see the future. The writer calls the project Brain Infinity
        Calculator. Yes, certain individuals have precognitive abilities. The
        project explains the inaccuracy of Freudian dream analysis, "The
        distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly
        persistent illusion." ~ Albert Einstein and preached the possibility
        that the second man within is immortal. In essence, all events exist at
        some point (The plane crash, when you will die, accidents, etc.). The
        writer explains that humankind can travel faster than the speed of
        light. The second man can even separate, witness, and feel the events in
        another dimension before the actual events happen. "To discover the
        Second Within will be a scientific and religious breakthrough because
        humankind will manipulate the universe."</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Those who had been paying attention to God's prophets in the Bible
        believed in understanding what would happen in the future. Others,
        especially religious people, believed that their "foresight" or
        foreknowledge came not from psychics or mediums or a supernatural
        ability but through listening to the Lord. Yes, there is a correlation
        between holiness and precognition. There is a second man within us that
        can foresee the future. Acts 11:28 (New International Version, NIV)
        states that "one of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit
        predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world.
        (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) Agabus exemplifies the
        power of the Holy Spirit in the early church. He foretold that a
        devastating famine would sweep over the Roman Empire. <br />
        According to one researcher, predicting the future boosts one's
        perceived capacity to exercise influence over future occurrences. The
        human mind is prone to prediction, and these cognitive systems play
        critical roles in facilitating survival and reproductive advantage and
        reducing psychological ambiguity about the future. The researcher
        claimed that it is not a surprise that precognitive beliefs follow a
        pattern comparable to superstitious beliefs (Greenaway et al., 2013)
        compared to Daryl Bem, professor emeritus of psychology, who stated, "It
        violates our notion of how the physical world works.</p>
